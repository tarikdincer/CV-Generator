"Objective: Develop CACTUS (cancer image annotating, calibrating, testing, understanding and sharing) as a novel web application for image archiving, annotation, grading, distribution, networking and evaluation. This helps pathologists to avoid unintended mistakes leading to quality assurance, teaching and evaluation in anatomical pathology. Effectiveness of the tool has been demonstrated by assessing pathologists performance in the grading of breast carcinoma and by comparing inter/intra-observer assessment of grading criteria amongst pathologists reviewing digital breast cancer images. Reproducibility has been assessed by inter-observer (kappa statistics) and intra-observer (intraclass correlation coefficient) concordance rates. Results: CACTUS has been evaluated using a surgical pathology application—the assessment of breast cancer grade. We used CACTUS to present standardized images to four pathologists of differing experience. They were asked to evaluate all images to determine their assessment of Nottingham grade of a series of breast carcinoma cases. For each image, they were asked for their overall grade impression. CACTUS helps and guides pathologists to improve disease diagnosis with higher confidence and thereby reduces their workload and bias. CACTUS can be useful for both disseminating anatomical pathology images for teaching, as well as for evaluating agreement amongst pathologists or against a gold standard for evaluation or quality assurance.","rank": 16,"year": 2020,"volume": 13,"issue": 1,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Alper Aksac","Tansel Ozyer","Douglas J.

Physicians find it hard to predict whether a given patient has already developed or is expected to develop the Parkinson’s disease in the future. To overcome this difficulty, it is possible to develop a computing model, which analyzes the data related to a given patient and predicts with acceptable accuracy when he/she is anticipated to develop the Parkinson’s disease. This paper contributes an attractive prediction framework based on some machine learning approaches. Several fuzzy classifiers have been employed in the process to distinguish people with Parkinsonism from healthy individuals.

Objectives:: This paper contributes an attractive prediction framework based on some machine learning approaches for distinguishing people with Parkinsonism from healthy individuals. Methods:: Several fuzzy classifiers such as Inductive Fuzzy Classifier, Fuzzy Rough Classifier and two types of neuro-fuzzy classifiers have been employed. Results:: The fuzzy classifiers utilized in this study have been tested using the “Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings Data Set” of 40 subjects available on the UCI repository. Conclusion:: The results achieved show that FURIA, MLP- Bagging - SGD, genfis2 and scg1 performed the best among the fuzzy rough, WEKA, adaptive neuro-fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy classifiers, respectively. The worst performance belongs to nearest neighborhood, IBK, genfis3 and scg3 among the formerly mentioned classifiers. The results reported in this paper are better in comparison to the results reported in Sakar et al., where the same dataset was used, with utilization of different classifiers. This demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the fuzzy classifiers used in this study as compared to the non-fuzzy classifiers used by Sakar et al.","rank": 20,"year": 2019,"volume": 12,"issue": 2,"startpage": 100,"endpage": 120,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Niousha Karimi Dastjerd","Onur Can Sert","Tansel Ozyer","Reda Alhajj"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Integrating SOM and fuzzy k-means clustering for customer classification in personalized recommendation system for non-text based transactional data","source": "2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/icitech.2017.8079966","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icitech.2017.8079966","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8053844/8079906/08079966.pdf?arnumber=8079966","rank": 21,"year": 2017,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Sukhpreet Dhaliwal","Ngoc Nhu Van","Manmeet Dhaliwal","Jon Rokne","Reda Alhajj","Tansel Ozyer"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Understanding the Impact of the Brand Experience on Brand Reputation by the Moderating Role of Technology Turbulence","source": "International Journal of Marketing Studies","issn": "1918-7203","publisher": "Canadian Center of Science and Education","doi": "10.5539/ijms.v8n1p161","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/ijms.v8n1p161","fulltext_url": "http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijms/article/viewFile/56922/30470","abstract": "<p>Brand experience is the conceptualization of the brand’s design, identity, packaging and connection that will remind the brand’s perceptual, cognitive, emotional and behavioral reflections.

The brand experience arises not only under a general constraint or emotion situation but also in a more customized and detailed combination of feelings, perceptions, emotions and behaviors. This combination points out that brand consumers evaluate the brands and companies not only with the general sense or general behavior but also with more complex combinations. Brand’s organizational reputation arises not only from brand’s reputation of being a reliable brand, but also from emotional appeal, products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, which are also associated with factors such as social and environmental responsibility and financial performance. Brand experience influences the formation of this multifactorial brand reputation. The consumers in contact with the brand perceive the reputation of the brand they consume according to their experience in an environment where technology and market change constantly.

vital applications, in addition to flexibility in managing personal collections of images. Traditional approaches employ keyword based indexing which is not very effective. Content based methods are more attractive though challenging and require considerable effort for automated feature extraction. In this chapter, we present a hybrid method for extracting features from images using a combination of already established methods, allowing them to be compared to a given input image as seen in other query-by-example methods. First, the image features are calculated using Edge Orientation Autocorrelograms and Color Correlograms. Then, distances of the images to the original image will be calculated using the L1 distance feature separately for both features. The distance sets will then be merged according to a weight supplied by the user. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","rank": 34,"year": 2013,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 91,"endpage": 104,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Görkem Asilioglu","Emine Merve Kaya","Duygu Sarikaya","Shang Gao","Tansel Ozyer","Jamal Jida","Reda Alhajj"]},{"type": "report","title": "Surficial geology, Arrowsmith River south, Nunavut","publisher": "Natural Resources Canada/CMSS/Information Management","doi": "10.4095/215112","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4095/215112","rank": 35,"year": 2004,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["C A Ozyer"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Human-animal recognition in camera trap images","source": "2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/siu.2018.8404700","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/siu.2018.8404700","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8394765/8404147/08404700.pdf?arnumber=8404700","rank": 36,"year": 2018,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Emrah Simsek","Baris Ozyer","Levent Bayindir","Gulsah Tumuklu Ozyer"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "SMS spam filtering based on text classification and expert system","source": "2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/siu.2015.7130350","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/siu.2015.7130350","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/7116933/7129794/07130350.pdf?arnumber=7130350","rank": 37,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Yavuz Selim Bozan","Onder Coban","Gulsah Tumuklu Ozyer","Baris Ozyer"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Reply to A Letter (Ms# 2010–0423) re: Aytekin, Yıldırım M, Ozyer U, Boyvat F (2010).

Methods:: A total of 144 arteriovenous accesses (37 radiocephalic, 51 brachiobasilic, 41 brachiocephalic, and 15 femorofemoral) from 143 patients were included in the study. A total of 304 endovascular thrombolytic treatment procedures were performed for 94 (65%) arteriovenous fistula and 50 (35%) arteriovenous graft accesses. Results:: The procedural technical success rate was 98.7%. The mean follow-up duration was 32.5 (range, 3–132) months. The primary patency rates for arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous grafts were 78% and 78% at 6 months, 66% and 63% at 1 year, and 45% and 0% at 36 months, respectively. The assisted primary patency rates for arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous grafts were 82% and 84% at 6 months, 71% and 69% at 1 year, 51% and 29% at 36 months, and 30% and 1% at 60 months, respectively. The secondary patency rates for arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous grafts were 94% and 93% at 6 months, 85% and 85% at 1 year, 58% and 59% at 36 months, and 47% and 48% at 60 months, respectively. Conclusion:: Although the primary patency durations for arteriovenous fistulas were better after endovascular thrombolytic treatment than those for arteriovenous grafts, the long-term outcomes of assisted primary and secondary patency durations after repeated procedures were similar for both types of arteriovenous accesses.","rank": 39,"year": 2019,"volume": 20,"issue": 5,"startpage": 545,"endpage": 552,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Yunus Yilmazsoy","Umut Ozyer"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Identifying kimberlite indicator mineral dispersal trains in the Pelly Bay region, Nunavut, Canada using GIS interpolation","source": "Geochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis","issn": "1467-7873","publisher": "Geological Society of London","doi": "10.1144/1467-7873/10-im-035","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/1467-7873/10-im-035","fulltext_url": "https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1144/1467-7873/10-IM-035","rank": 40,"year": 2011,"volume": 11,"issue": 4,"startpage": 335,"endpage": 350,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["C.A.

It is evident that in this process wherein the individuals interact with each other, their attitudes towards each other affect the process of creating mutual behaviors and perceptions. On one hand individuals may harm each other through unethical or counterproductive behaviors and on the other hand, even if there is no intention to harm, the behavior of the individual with whom one interacts can be perceived as aggressive. All these scenarios cause anger rumination in individuals, which can be defined as one’s contemplating over the reasons of behavior or attitudes through anger while spending a lot of time. Meanwhile, anger can be defined as creating a negative emotion towards any cognitive assessments, psychological changes and tendencies of action. That this process of creating emotions is evaluated for a long period of time via rumination may lead to the assumption that the affects of the employee change due to anger rumination. On the other hand, the employee creativity emerging during the activities of individuals in their respective workplaces depend on a highly emotional evaluation. This study has been prepared to determine whether, especially in the case of white-collar workers experiencing anger rumination, that has an effect on their individual creativity. The relation between the anger rumination and the employee creativity constitutes this study’s distinctive aspect. The data obtained from this research propose that the creativity is a basic need of companies and that determining the impact level of the anger rumination on the creativity and taking counter-measures against the anger rumination may contribute to the building of an innovative company in a competitive market.","rank": 42,"year": 2016,"volume": 11,"issue": 2,"startpage": 53,"endpage": 53,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ebru Gozukara","Yagmur Ozyer"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Task dependent human-like grasping","source": "Humanoids 2008 - 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/ichr.2008.4755949","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ichr.2008.4755949","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/4747411/4755922/04755949.pdf?arnumber=4755949","rank": 43,"year": 2008,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Baris Ozyer","Erhan Oztop"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Tandem ureteral stents in the management of double-J stent dysfunction in gynecological malignancies","source": "Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging","issn": "2211-5684","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.diii.2017.07.005","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diii.2017.07.005","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S221156841730195X","rank": 44,"year": 2017,"volume": 98,"issue": 9,"startpage": 601,"endpage": 608,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["U.

"http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/jets/article/viewFile/4655/4886","abstract": "Reinforcement is one of the widely used practices in today's educational environments. Teachers often use reinforcement as a form of discipline in the classroom, and these reinforcements allow students to learn new ideas, skills, and rules. Reinforcers can be used effectively in teaching of the social and academic skills as well as in reducing or eliminating problem behaviors. Therefore, this study aims at identifying how pre-school teachers in inclusive classes employ secondary reinforcers for the students with special needs. The study is designed as a descriptive research. The participants of the study are four pre-school teachers working in Ankara who teach students with special needs. In this study, the data were collected through the Teacher and Student Information Form and Learned Reinforcement Checklist which was developed by the author. The findings of the study indicate that the participants mostly use social reinforcers. In other words, they all prefer to use social reinforcers such as praise words and applauding for the students with special needs. The findings of the study indicate that the participants employ limited number of activity reinforcers and all teachers participated in the study employed token reinforcers for the students with special needs.","rank": 76,"year": 2020,"volume": 8,"issue": 4,"startpage": 1,"endpage": 1,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yazıcıoğlu"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Reflections of Developments in Information Technologies to Internal Audit: Blockchain Technology and Continuous Auditing","source": "Auditing Ecosystem and Strategic Accounting in the Digital Era","issn": "2730-6038","publisher": "Springer International Publishing","doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-72628-7_16","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72628-7_16","fulltext_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-72628-7_16","rank": 77,"year": 2021,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 339,"endpage": 359,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Cetinoglu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs): a new approach to solid dosage forms","source": "Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin","issn": "1857-8969","publisher": "Macedonian Pharmaceutical Association","doi": "10.33320/maced.pharm.bull.2020.66.03.047","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.33320/maced.pharm.bull.2020.66.03.047","fulltext_url": "http://bulletin.mfd.org.mk/volumes/Volume%2066_3/66_3_047.pdf","rank": 78,"year": 2020,"volume": 66,"issue": 3,"startpage": 95,"endpage": 96,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Comoglu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Cigarette demand, health scares and education in Turkey","source": "Applied Economics","issn": "0003-6846","publisher": "Informa UK Limited","doi": "10.1080/00036849300000060","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036849300000060","fulltext_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00036849300000060","rank": 79,"year": 1993,"volume": 25,"issue": 4,"startpage": 521,"endpage": 529,"cites": 36,"ecc": 36,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Persistence times of refractory materials in landfills: A review of rate limiting conditions by mass transfer and reaction kinetics","source": "Journal of Environmental Management","issn": "0301-4797","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.056","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.056","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301479719308576","rank": 80,"year": 2019,"volume": 247,"issue": 0,"startpage": 88,"endpage": 103,"cites": 6,"ecc": 6,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "1768 SEFERİ HAKKINDA BİR ARAŞTIRMA","source": "Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi","issn": "0378-2905","publisher": "Ankara University -  Faculty of Language and History-Geography","doi": "10.1501/dtcfder_0000000254","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1501/dtcfder_0000000254","rank": 81,"year": 1950,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 475,"endpage": 536,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Salahattin TANSEL"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Determining the Views of School Principals and Guidance Teachers on Inclusive Practices at Anatolian High-Schools","source": "Journal of Education and Learning","issn": "1927-5269","publisher": "Canadian Center of Science and Education","doi": "10.5539/jel.v9n1p87","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/jel.v9n1p87","fulltext_url": "http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jel/article/download/0/0/41753/43352","abstract": "The number of students who attend an inclusive school in Turkey has been increasing. This increase in the number of students attending inclusive education makes the inclusive policies more significant and requires that schools of all types and levels should be ready for inclusive practices. This study aims at uncovering the views of school administrators and guidance teachers working at Anatolian high schools concerning the inclusive education. The data of the study were collected through focus group interviews. The study was carried out in Ankara during the school year of 2018&ndash;2019 with a sample of school administrators and guidance teachers working at different Anatolian high schools. The findings of the study indicate that there are serious problems in inclusive education practices at Anatolian high schools, the educational setting needed for students with special education needs cannot be provided and teachers do not have necessary experience in inclusive education.","rank": 82,"year": 2020,"volume": 9,"issue": 1,"startpage": 87,"endpage": 87,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use":

However,the capability to maintain temporal data is a crucial requirement for many organizations and provides the base for organizational intelligence. A temporal database maintains time-varying data, that is, past, present, and future data. In this chapter, we focus on the relational data model and address the subtle issues in modeling and designing temporal databases. A common approach to handle temporal data within the traditional relational databases is the addition of time columns to a relation. Though this appears to be a simple and intuitive solution, it does not address many subtle issues peculiar to temporal data, that is, comparing database states at two different time points, capturing the periods for concurrent events and accessing times beyond these periods, handling multi-valued attributes, coalescing and restructuring temporal data, and so forth, [Gadia 1988, Tansel and Tin 1997].

Yet, despite a burgeoning body of literature built on the transdisciplinary efforts bridging International Relations and its long-separated nomothetic relatives, the new and emerging conceptual frameworks have not been able to effectively overcome the challenge posed by the ‘non-West’. The recent wave of international historical sociology has highlighted possible trajectories to problematise the myopic and unipolar conceptions of the international system; however, the question of Eurocentrism still lingers in the developing research programmes. This article interjects into the ongoing historical materialist debate in international historical sociology by: (1) conceptually and empirically challenging the rigid boundaries of the extant approaches; and (2) critically assessing the postulations of recent theorising on ‘the international’, capitalist states-system/geopolitics and uneven and combined development. While the significance of the present contributions in international historical sociology should not be understated, it is argued that the ‘Eurocentric cage’ still occupies a dominant ontological position which essentially silences ‘connected histories’ and conceals the role of inter-societal relations in the making of the modern states-system and capitalist geopolitics.","rank": 231,"year": 2014,"volume": 21,"issue": 1,"startpage": 76,"endpage": 100,"cites": 24,"ecc": 24,"use": 1,"authors": ["Cemal Burak Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Decrease in osmotically driven water flux and transport through mangrove roots after oil spills in the presence and absence of dispersants","source": "Marine Pollution Bulletin","issn": "0025-326X","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.07.016","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.07.016","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0025326X15004361","rank": 232,"year": 2015,"volume": 98,"issue": 1,"startpage": 34,"endpage": 39,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel","Ariadna Arreaza","Derya Z.

This approach utilizes the unique relationship between externally created feed direction tool displacements (input) and the resultant thrust direction workpiece vibrations (output) to estimate stability limits in three-dimensional turning operations from the data of a single dynamic cutting test. In this paper, this unique relationship is referred to as the “Unified Transfer Function ” (UTF) and its expressions are derived from conventional cutting and structural dynamics transfer functions. For the stability analysis, the uncut chip area variations of oblique cutting are represented by a linear model having different coefficients at different depths of cuts. These coefficients are found by using a tool geometry simulation program. An iterative procedure is developed for the stability analysis. The proposed approach considers in-process structural and cutting dynamics and can be automatically implemented without any input from the operator for the traverse turning of a long slender bar. Experimental studies have validated the proposed modeling and stability analysis techniques. The UTFs can also be used to monitor machine tool structure, tool wear, and the machinability of the material.","rank": 241,"year": 1993,"volume": 115,"issue": 2,"startpage": 193,"endpage": 204,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["I.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of impact forces and momentum transfer between different hand preshapes landing on an object. Momentum transfer parameters lead to modification of object orientation and position at the very initial stage of task after that preshaped fingers land on the object. We model fingers as particles in a solidified environment while the medium squeezed by hand preshape that is closing upon an object, is modeled as a compressible fluid where momentum is propagated until hitting the surface of the solidified particle medium of the object. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics model (SPH) is used to simulate the general dynamic of fluid flows and momentum transfer between particles of different media. The fingers of the robotic hand are modeled by solidified fluid particles interacting with compressible surrounding fluids in which objects are defined as rigid-body solidified fluid particles. The developed model has been applied, in this paper, to the simulation of various simple robot hand preshaping and the generated momentum transfer profiles an object surface have been analyzed.","rank": 260,"year": 2010,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Baris Ozyer","Ismet Erkmen","Aydan M.

"The development of a systematic approach which can be used as a decision-making tool to extend or shorten the post-closure care (PCC) period requires technically sound and justifiable methods. These methods can incorporate analysis and interpretation of available data and information from closed landfill. Analysis of existing data from closed landfills may present challenges due to variations in the data collection procedures, data analysis methods and reporting methodologies used during active and post-closure periods of a landfill. A tiered decision matrix was developed to assess and verify the quality of monitoring data collected and documented from closed landfills. The matrix provides a baseline for the needs to improve the quality of data collection and documentation for current and future practices. Challenges due to discrepancies in data reporting and inconsistencies in quality assurance/quality control protocols during data collection, reporting, and analyses are presented with case studies. Solutions are presented to validate and improve the quality of available data based on this study.","rank": 275,"year": 2011,"volume": 30,"issue": 2,"startpage": 171,"endpage": 180,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Banu Sizirici","Berrin Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Türkiye'de işçi dövizlerinin toplam üretim büyümesine makroekonomik etkisi - Macroeconomic impact of remittances on output growth: Evidence from Turkey","source": "Migration Letters","issn": "1741-8992","publisher": "Transnational Press London","doi": "10.33182/ml.v9i4.120","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.33182/ml.v9i4.120","fulltext_url": "https://journals.tplondon.com/ml/article/download/120/113","abstract": "In this study, a Keynesian model studying simultaneously, the impact of immigrant workers’ foreign currency transfers on macro variables such as consumption, investment, imports and income of Turkey is presented.

With regard to its multiplying impact on income, it is observed that immigrant workers’ foreign currency transfers increases income notably. While the output growth resulting from immigrant workers’ foreign currency transfers reached highest level at the beginning of the seventies and the eighties, output growth during other periods, was negligibly low.[IN TURKISH]Göçmen dövizleri gelişmekte olan ülkeler için önemli bir dış finansman kaynağıdır.

Subgoal graphs can be considered as a framework that can be customized to different domains through the choice of a reachability relation R that identifies pairs of nodes on a graph between which it is easy to find shortest paths. Subgoal graphs can exploit R in various ways to speed-up query times and reduce memory requirements. In this paper, we break down the differences between N-level subgoal graphs and contraction hierarchies, and augment contraction hierarchies with ideas from subgoal graphs to exploit R. We propose three different modifications, analyze their runtime/memory trade-offs, and provide experimental results on grids using canonical-freespace-reachability as R, which show that both N-level subgoal graphs and contraction hierarchies are dominated in terms of the runtime/memory trade-off by some of our new variants.","rank": 306,"year": 2018,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Uras","Sven Koenig"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Effective Clustering by Iterative Approach","source": "Computer and Information Sciences - ISCIS 2005","issn": "0302-9743","publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg","doi": "10.1007/11569596_85","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11569596_85","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/11569596_85.pdf","rank": 307,"year": 2005,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 833,"endpage": 842,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Özyer","Reda Alhajj"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Does Private Tutoring Increase Studentss Academic Performance?

The purpose of this study is to improve mechanical properties of acrylic based dental composites used in dentistry by applying nanofiber approaches. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used as a base acrylic denture material with benefits of rapid and easy handling but sometime this material can be fractured or cracked in clinical use because of the strength issues that is frequently used in restorative dentistry in recent years. A wide variety of fillers that are used to produce PMMA composites draw the attention in literature. Using PMMA composite resins with electrospun polyvinylalcohol (PVA) nanofiber fillers is our first novelty. Also the producing and using aligned electrospun fibers as a filler is our second novelty of this practice. PVA was selected as composite filler because of biocompatibility and preparing easily also has non-toxic solvent. Electrospinning system is manufactured that allows manipulation of electric field used in the application of alignment in lab scale. Various auxillary electrode systems are used for different patterns of alignment with the manufactured device and electrode systems produce fibers in different range of diameter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used for physical characterization and determined the range of fiber diameters. After the optimization of concentration step non-woven and aligned fibers are also analyzed. Non-woven fiber has no unique pattern because of the nature of electrospinning but aligned fibers has crossed lines. These produced fibers structured as layer-by-layer form with different features are used in producing PMMA dental composites with different volume ratios. In the last part of the research, PMMA dental composites are produced with aligned and formless fibers that are characterized with three-point bending test. The maximum flexural strength figure shows that fiber load by weight %0.25 and above improves the maximum. The change of flexural strength, elastic modulus values and toughness are obtained and compared with formless and aligned PVA nanofiber included composite specimens. As a result, mechanical properties of PMMA dental composites are improved with using PVA nanofibers as a filler also with the usage of aligned fibers instead of the formless ones the effects of improvement gets better with maximum values as 5.1 MPa (flexural strength), 0.8 GPa (elastic modulus), 170kJ/m","rank": 309,"year": 2014,"volume": 1685,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Uyar","Dilek Cokeliler"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "On Set-Theoretic Model Reference Adaptive Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems Subject to Actuator Dynamics","source": "2018 AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi": "10.2514/6.2018-1573","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2018-1573","fulltext_url": "https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2018-1573","rank": 310,"year": 2018,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Temettü Politikası, Temettü Dağıtım Oranı ve Finansal Performans Arasındaki İlişkinin İncelenmesi - The Investigaton of Relationship Between Dividend Policy, Payout Ratio and Financial Performance","source": "Journal of Business Research - Turk","issn": "1309-0712","publisher": "Journal of Business Research - Turk","doi": "10.20491/isarder.2017.259","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.20491/isarder.2017.259","rank": 311,"year": 2017,"volume": 9,"issue": 2,"startpage": 133,"endpage": 149,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Hüseyin Temiz","Tansel Hacıhasanoğlu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Returns to Education in Palestine and Turkey: A Comparative Analysis","source": "Perspectives on Global Development and Technology","issn": "1569-1500","publisher": "Brill","doi": "10.1163/15691497-12341306","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15691497-12341306","fulltext_url": "https://brill.com/view/journals/pgdt/13/3/article-p347_4.xml","abstract": "This study exposes a comparative treatment of the private returns to education in Palestine and Turkey over the period 2004-2008.

The data for this study consists of 3633 firms in manufacturing and services sectors. We investigate the effect of firm resources on the adoption of ICT by using ordered logit model. Adoption of ICT is an index variable including four categories which ranges from single technology ownership to four technology ownership. These technologies are local area network (LAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), intranet, and extranet. We assume that these technologies are complementary. We find that firms do not need to use same amount of resources while adopting single technology as they would while adopting complementary technologies. In the adoption of complementary technologies, the effect of firm size, trade openness, human capital, purposes of ICT usage and environmental factors such as region and industry increases. On the other hand, full complementarity among technologies does not require the full exploitation of the firm resources. As a result of inefficient use of firm resources, single and two technology owner firms, which are composed of resource-limited small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), do not accomplish the technology adoption benefits of the three and four technology owners. We discuss a set of policy implications to promote the efficient use of firm resources for single and two technology owner firms. The effect of firm resources on the adoption of complementary technologies is analysed in this study which has not been investigated before in this context.","rank": 327,"year": 2018,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 978,"endpage": 999,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Derya Findik","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Enhancement of media filter performance with coagulant use for treatment of diesel oil contaminated surface water","source": "Desalination","issn": "0011-9164","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.desal.2004.08.028","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2004.08.028","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0011916404006873","rank": 328,"year": 2005,"volume": 173,"issue": 1,"startpage": 69,"endpage": 76,"cites": 15,"ecc": 15,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel","Frank Vilar"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Occurrence of Aflatoxins in Food","source": "Aflatoxins - Recent Advances and Future Prospects","publisher": "InTech","doi": "10.5772/51031","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/51031","fulltext_url": "http://www.intechopen.com/download/pdf/38172","rank": 329,"year": 2013,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 9,"ecc": 9,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ayhan Filazi","Ufuk Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Does private tutoring increase students’ academic performance?

"<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>In the 20th century and especially in the 21st century, the theory and the concepts such as simulation', ‘manipulation', ‘illusion', 'secret' and 'reality' have been interpreted differently from old times in several disciplines especially in visual arts. Some misleading techniques within various methods and aesthetic rules have been applied in the way that they deal with these concepts which are contained in art dynamics serving as a language of visual expression. Though the performed images within ‘Anamorphosis', its alias ‘anamorphic illusion' technique which is one of the most interesting techniques, at first glance look like difficult and chaotic constructions to solve, they represent a fictitious image, space or surface with the purpose of deceiving and they also include visual effects, deformation, and utopia.In the anamorphic works that change as long as it moves and can only be resolved from a specific point and angle, they become a part of the spectator composition in order to discover the truth and meaning and thus interactive situations also occur.</p><p>In this research, with an overview of the anamorphous technique’s form and development in historical process, was carried out in order to examine and evaluate the approach styles of the concept of Illusion which has modern artist Felice Varini who interprets this technique by associating with light, color, texture, mass, place, space, spacing and surface concepts. In accordance with the aim of the study, firstly the definition, types, methods and development process of the Anamorphosis technique have been examined, then some examples of Varini's work, which the first sight are perceived as having complex fragments and manipulating the perception of space at the same time have been presented and the effect of this situation on the viewer and the way of interpretation depending on the misleading features have been discussed.</p><p><strong>Öz</strong></p><p>20. yüzyıl ve özellikle de 21. yüzyılda ‘simülasyon’, ‘manipülasyon’, ‘yanılsama’, ‘giz’ ve ‘gerçeklik’ gibi kuram ve kavramlar, başta görsel sanatlar olmak üzere çeşitli disiplinlerde önceki dönemlerden farklı biçimlerde yorumlanmıştır. Görsel anlatım diline hizmet eden sanat dinamiklerinin içinde barındırdığı bu kavramları ele alış biçimlerinde çeşitli yöntemler ve estetik kuralları dâhilinde de bazı yanıltıcı teknikler uygulanmıştır. En ilgi çekici tekniklerden biri olan ‘anamorfoz’ diğer adıyla ‘anamorfik illüzyon’ tekniği ile gerçekleştirilen görüntüler, ilk bakışta her ne kadar çözümlenmesi zor ve kaotik yapılar gibi gözükseler de yanıltma amacıyla birlikte gerçeği, imgeyi, mekânı veya yüzeyi temsil etmektedirler. Aynı zamanda bu görüntüler deformasyonu, görsel efekti ve ütopyayı da içinde barındırmaktadırlar. Hareket edildiği sürece değişen, ancak belirli bir noktadan ve açıdan çözümlenebilen anamorfik çalışmalarda gerçeği ve anlamı keşfetme yolunda, seyirci kompozisyonun parçası haline gelmekte ve bu sayede bazı interaktif durumlar da gerçekleşmektedir.</p><p>Bu araştırma, anamorfoz tekniğinin biçemine ve tarihsel süreçte gelişimine genel bir bakış ile birlikte; bu tekniği ışık, renk, doku, kütle, mekân, uzam, espas ve yüzey kavramlarıyla ilişkilendirerek yorumlayan Çağdaş sanatçı Felice Varini’nin ‘yanılsama’ kavramına yaklaşım biçimlerini incelemek ve değerlendirmek amacıyla gerçekleştirilmiştir. Çalışma amacı doğrultusunda, ilk önce Anamorfoz tekniğinin tanımı, çeşitleri, yöntemleri ve gelişim süreci incelenmiş, sonrasında ise Varini’nin ilk bakışta karmaşık parçalara sahipmiş gibi algılanan ve aynı zamanda mekân algısını manipüle eden çalışmalarından bazı örnekler sunularak izleyici üzerinde yarattığı etki ve yanıltıcı özelliklerine bağlı olarak yorumlama biçimleri ele alınmıştır.</p>","rank": 354,"year": 2018,"volume": 7,"issue": 1,"startpage": 527,"endpage": 527,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Mustafa Kocalan","Tansel Türkdoğan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "MICROSCOPIC IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO CHARACTERIZE SURFACE MORPHOLOGY AND ADSORPTION MECHANISMS OF ACTIVATED CARBON","source": "Proceedings of the Water Environment Federation","issn": "1938-6478","publisher": "Water Environment Federation","doi": "10.2175/193864700785155867","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/193864700785155867","fulltext_url": "http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wef/wefproc/2000/00002000/00000005/art00005","rank": 355,"year": 2000,"volume": 2000,"issue": 5,"startpage": 57,"endpage": 62,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel","Pradeep Nagarajan"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "On Achieving Predictable Adaptive Control Response for Uncertain Dynamical Systems with Large Domains of Operation","source": "AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi": "10.2514/6.2012-4774","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2012-4774","fulltext_url": "http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2012-4774","rank": 356,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yucelen","Eric Johnson"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Adaptive control of uncertain systems with gain scheduled reference models and constrained control inputs","source": "2014 American Control Conference","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/acc.2014.6859326","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/acc.2014.6859326","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6849600/6858556/06859326.pdf?arnumber=6859326","rank": 357,"year": 2014,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Mehrdad Pakmehr","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Instagram’da Zamana Yolculuk: Nostalji Algısının Yeniden Üretilmesi ve Tbt’nin Kullanım Pratikleri Üzerine","source": "Etkileşim","issn": "2636-7955","publisher": "Uskudar University","doi": "10.32739/etkilesim.2019.4.72","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.32739/etkilesim.2019.4.72","abstract": "Sosyalleşme ve iletişim devriminin simgesi olan İnternet’in ortak ürünü olan sosyal medya, adeta alacakaranlıkta sürdürülen ilişkiler sayesinde, bireylerin ideolojik ve sosyal baskılardan uzaklaşmasını sağlayarak yeni bir kimlik alanı da açmaktadır.

In this way, the data can be understood and used more efficiently by scientists. Numerous studies have been proposed in the literature for the problem of data classification. However, with recently introduced metaheuristics, it has continued to be riveting to revisit this classical problem and investigate the efficiency of new techniques. Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a recent metaheuristic that has been reported to be very effective for combinatorial optimization problems. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid TLBO algorithm with extreme learning machines (ELM) for the solution of data classification problems. The proposed algorithm (TLBO-ELM) is tested on a set of UCI benchmark datasets.

macro-econometric model to investigate the impact of remittances on key macro variables such as consumption, investment, imports and income in Turkey. The estimated impact and dynamic multipliers indicate that impact of remittances on consumption, imports and income are all positive and reduce gradually while that on investment wears out in the second year. The impact multiplier for income implies a substantial increase in income due to remittances through the multiplier process. The remittances-induced output growth rate is highest during the early 1970s and the early 1980s, but negligible during the other years.","rank": 398,"year": 2014,"volume": 7,"issue": 2,"startpage":

Stochastic production frontier approach is used to simultaneously estimate the production function and the determinants of technical efficiency in the software intensive manufacturing firms in Turkey for the period 2003-2007. Firms are classified based on the technology group. High technology and low technology firms are estimated separately in order to reveal differentials in their firm efficiency. The results show that the effect of software investment on firm efficiency is larger in high technology firms which operate in areas such as chemicals, electricity, and machinery as compared to that of the low technology firms which operate in areas such as textiles, food, paper, and unclassified manufacturing. Further, among the high technology firms, the effect of the software investment is smaller than the effect of research and development personnel expenditure. This result shows that the presence of R&D personnel is more important than the software investment for software intensive manufacturing firms in Turkey.","rank": 416,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 179,"endpage": 202,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Derya Fındık","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Price and income effects in Turkish foreign trade","source": "Review of World Economics","issn": "1610-2878","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/bf02707760","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf02707760","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02707760.pdf","rank": 417,"year": 1987,"volume": 123,"issue": 3,"startpage": 521,"endpage": 534,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Sübidey Togan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Reclamation planning for coal mine in Istanbul, Agacli Region","source": "Environmental Geology","issn": "0943-0105","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s00254-007-1144-5","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1144-5","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00254-007-1144-5.pdf","rank": 418,"year": 2007,"volume": 56,"issue": 1,"startpage": 109,"endpage": 117,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Dogan","Ali Kahriman"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Management-Employee Relations, Firm Size and Job Satisfaction","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2233483","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2233483","rank": 419,"year": 2013,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 7,"ecc": 7,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Saziye Gazioglu"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Active noise blocking: Non-minimal modeling, robust control, and implementation","source": "2009 American Control Conference","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/acc.2009.5160439","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/acc.2009.5160439","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/5089257/5159764/05160439.pdf?arnumber=5160439","rank": 420,"year": 2009,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yucelen","Farzad Pourboghrat"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "The Causal Effect of Education on Health Behaviors: Evidence from Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2803852","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2803852","rank": 421,"year": 2016,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Deniz Karaoglan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "SEM study of phenolphthalein adsorption on granular activated carbon","source": "Advances in Environmental Research","issn": "1093-0191","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/s1093-0191(02)00126-0","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1093-0191(02)00126-0","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1093019102001260","rank": 422,"year": 2004,"volume": 8,"issue": 3,"startpage": 411,"endpage": 415,"cites": 31,"ecc": 31,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel","Pradeep Nagarajan"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "A generalization to set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture for enforcing user-defined time-varying performance bounds","source": "2017 American Control Conference (ACC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.23919/acc.2017.7963742","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/acc.2017.7963742","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/7951530/7962914/07963742.pdf?arnumber=7963742","rank": 423,"year": 2017,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 9,"ecc": 9,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Wave Propagation and Structural Health Monitoring Application on Parts Fabricated by Additive Manufacturing","source": "Automation","issn": "2673-4052","publisher": "MDPI AG","doi": "10.3390/automation2030011","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/automation2030011","fulltext_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4052/2/3/11/pdf","abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) applications have been steadily increasing in many industry sectors. AM allows creating complex geometries inside of a part to leave some space empty, called infills. Lighter parts are manufactured in a shorter time with less warpage if the strength of the part meets the design requirements. While the benefits of structural health monitoring (SHM) have been proven in different structures, few studies have investigated SHM methods on AM parts. In this study, the relationship between wave propagation and infill density has been studied for the additively manufactured polymer parts. The propagation of surface waves is monitored by using piezoelectric elements. Four rectangular parts are manufactured by using the material extrusion method with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 100% rectilinear infill densities. Four piezoelectric elements were attached on the surface of each beam, one for excitation and three for monitoring the response of the part at equal distances on each part. The results demonstrated that the surface waves diminish faster at parts with lower densities. The received signal in the part with totally solid infills showed about 10 times higher amplitudes compare with the part with 20% infill. The surface response to excitation (SuRE) method was used for sensing the loading on the part. Also, the wave propagation speed was calculated with exciting parts with a pulse signal with a 10-microsecond duration.

The data for this study consists of 3633 firms in manufacturing and services sectors. We investigate the effect of firm resources on the adoption of ICT by using ordered logit model. Adoption of ICT is an index variable including four categories which ranges from single technology ownership to four technology ownership. These technologies are local area network (LAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), intranet, and extranet. We assume that these technologies are complementary. We find that firms do not need to use same amount of resources while adopting single technology as they would while adopting complementary technologies. In the adoption of complementary technologies, the effect of firm size, trade openness, human capital, purposes of ICT usage and environmental factors such as region and industry increases. On the other hand, full complementarity among technologies does not require the full exploitation of the firm resources. As a result of inefficient use of firm resources, single and two technology owner firms, which are composed of resource-limited small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), do not accomplish the technology adoption benefits of the three and four technology owners. We discuss a set of policy implications to promote the efficient use of firm resources for single and two technology owner firms. The effect of firm resources on the adoption of complementary technologies is analysed in this study which has not been investigated before in this context.","rank": 444,"year": 2016,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 106,"endpage": 126,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Derya Findik","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "A Generalized Time Transformation Method for Finite-Time Control*","source": "2019 American Control Conference (ACC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.23919/acc.2019.8815010","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/acc.2019.8815010","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8789884/8814292/08815010.pdf?arnumber=8815010","rank": 445,"year": 2019,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Dzung Tran","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Resources on the Stage: A Firm Level Analysis of the ICT Adoption in Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2640027","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2640027","rank": 446,"year": 2014,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Derya Findik","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Enforcing Spatiotemporal Constraints in Control of Multiagent Systems with Uncertainties","source": "2019 American Control Conference (ACC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.23919/acc.2019.8815116","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/acc.2019.8815116","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8789884/8814292/08815116.pdf?arnumber=8815116","rank": 447,"year": 2019,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "On Performance Improvement of Gain-Scheduled Model Reference Adaptive Control Laws","source": "AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi": "10.2514/6.2020-1118","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2020-1118","rank": 448,"year": 2020,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Kevin Wilcher","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Design and analysis of a novel command governor architecture for shaping the transient response of nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems","source": "2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/cdc.2012.6426157","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cdc.2012.6426157","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/6416474/6425800/06426157.pdf?arnumber=6426157","rank": 449,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yucelen","Eric Johnson"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Political Business Cycles, Institutional Structure and Budget Deficits in Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.267053","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.267053","rank": 450,"year": 2001,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ibrahim Tutar","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Modeling micro-end-milling operations.

Design/methodology/approach: – The authors first investigate the management-employee relationships and the firm size using maximum likelihood probit estimation. Next various measures of job satisfaction are related to the management-employee relations via maximum likelihood ordered probit estimates. Four measures of job satisfaction that have not been used often are considered. They are satisfaction with influence over job; satisfaction with amount of pay; satisfaction with sense of achievement and satisfaction with respect from supervisors. Findings: – Main findings indicate that management-employee relationships are less satisfactory in the large firms than in the small firms. Job satisfaction levels are lower in large firms. Less satisfactory management-employee relationships in the large firms may be a major source of the observed lower level of job satisfaction in them. Practical implications: – These results have important policy implications from the point of view of the firm management while achieving the aims of their organizations in particular in the large firms in the area of management-employee relationships. Improving the management-employee relations in large firms will increase employee satisfaction in many respects as well as increase productivity and reduce turnover. Originality/value: – The nature of the management-employee relations with firm size and job satisfaction has not been investigated before.","rank": 472,"year": 2014,"volume": 35,"issue": 8,"startpage": 1260,"endpage": 1275,"cites": 17,"ecc": 17,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Şaziye Gazîoğlu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Explosion impacts during transport of hazardous cargo: GIS-based characterization of overpressure impacts and delineation of flammable zones for ammonia","source": "Journal of Environmental Management","issn": "0301-4797","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.02.044","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.02.044","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301479715001218","rank": 473,"year": 2015,"volume": 156,"issue": 0,"startpage": 1,"endpage": 9,"cites": 23,"ecc": 23,"use": 1,"authors": ["Bahareh Inanloo","Berrin Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Set-theoretic model reference adaptive control with time-varying performance bounds","source": "International Journal of Control","issn": "0020-7179","publisher": "Informa UK Limited","doi": "10.1080/00207179.2018.1442026","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207179.2018.1442026","fulltext_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00207179.2018.1442026","rank": 474,"year": 2018,"volume": 92,"issue": 11,"startpage": 2509,"endpage": 2520,"cites": 17,"ecc": 17,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Removal of crude oil from highly contaminated natural surfaces with corexit dispersants","source": "Journal of Environmental Management","issn": "0301-4797","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.091","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.091","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301479719308928","rank": 475,"year": 2019,"volume": 247,"issue": 0,"startpage": 363,"endpage": 370,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Berrin Tansel","Mengshan Lee"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "A set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture with dead-zone effect","source": "Control Engineering Practice","issn": "0967-0661","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.conengprac.2019.05.010","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conengprac.2019.05.010","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0967066118305884","rank": 476,"year": 2019,"volume": 89,"issue": 0,"startpage": 12,"endpage": 29,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Do Different Orthodontic Malocclusions Affect Patients’ Self-Concept and Psychosocial Status?","source": "Turkish Journal of Orthodontics","issn": "2528-9659","publisher": "AVES Publishing Co.","doi": "10.5152/turkjorthod.2016.160007","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5152/turkjorthod.2016.160007","rank": 477,"year": 2016,"volume": 29,"issue": 2,"startpage": 27,"endpage": 30,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Serpil Cokakoglu","Ruhi Nalcaci","Evrim Aktepe","Gokhan Ozyer"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Age-stratified analysis of tumor markers and tumor characteristics in adolescents and young women with mature cystic teratoma","source": "Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","issn": "1726-4901","publisher": "Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","doi": "10.1016/j.jcma.2017.07.005","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2017.07.005","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S172649011730196X","rank": 478,"year": 2018,"volume": 81,"issue": 6,"startpage": 499,"endpage": 504,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["Huseyin Yesilyurt","Berna Seckin","Ayla Aktulay","Sebnem Ozyer"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "An Active-Passive Networked Multiagent Systems Approach to Environment Surveillance","source": "AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi": "10.2514/6.2015-2004","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2004","fulltext_url": "http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2015-2004","rank": 479,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 6,"ecc": 6,"use": 1,"authors": ["John D.

The government’s relief efforts were tainted by corruption as well, and exhibited a great deal of incompetence. How voters responded to these in the next election held in 2002 is investigated. The fact that different group of parties were responsible for the construction of the shoddy buildings, and for the corruption and mismanagement related to relief, provided us with a unique opportunity to determine whether and how the electorate punished the culprits for each of these. The purpose of this paper is to shed light also on the new party system which emerged in Turkey after 2002. Design/methodology/approach: – Vote equations are estimated for the seven major political parties. These are fitted to cross-provincial data individually, using ordinary least squares and robust regression methods, and as a system, using seemingly unrelated regressions procedures. The same picture emerges from each of these methods. Findings: – Not just those ruling at the time of the earthquakes, but also other parties which were in power when the substandard buildings, were built were held accountable by the electorate. Furthermore, the Turkish voters appear to have allocated the blame rationally, taking into consideration the division of labor in the central government, and the relative influences the parties had on local administrations. Reaction of the voters to government incompetence and corruption was one of the factors which resulted in the emergence of a new party system. In 2002, the AKP, established only a year before, captured almost all of the far-right Islamist, about half of the far-right nationalist, and more than half of the center-right votes in 2002. Originality/value: – Corruption usually makes little difference in the fortunes of politicians. Some recent studies suggest that it takes more than just exposure of corruption to get the voters to react.

On the other hand, control of growth direction and crystal orientation of nanowires, which determine their electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, stand as major issues in VLS technique. In this study, we demonstrate a new vapor-liquid-solid glancing angle deposition (VLS-GLAD) fabrication approach to produce crystalline semiconductor nanowires with controlled geometry. VLS-GLAD is a physical vapor deposition nanowire fabrication approach based on selective deposition of nanowire source atoms onto metal catalyst nanoislands placed on a crystal wafer. In this technique, collimated obliquely incident flux of source atoms selectively deposit on catalyst islands by using “shadowing effect”. Geometrical showing effect combined with conventional VLS growth mechanism leads to the growth of tilted crystalline semiconductor nanowire arrays. In this study, we report morphological and structural properties of tilted single crystal germanium nanowire arrays fabricated by utilizing a conventional thermal evaporation system. In addition to the tilted geometry, by introducing substrate rotation, nanowires with various morphologies including helical, zig-zag, or vertical shapes can be fabricated. Engineering crystalline nanowire morphology by using VLS-GLAD have the potential of enabling control of optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of these nanostructures leading to the development of novel 3D nano-devices.","rank": 491,"year": 2011,"volume": 1350,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["Arif S.

For this purpose, the relationship between economic freedom and economic growth, and the relationship between economic freedom and total factor productivity in OECD countries were investigated by using panel data for the period of 1995-2009. Study employed the recently developed cointegration test by Westerlund (2007) and the estimation technique by Bai and Kao (2006) which account for cross-sectional dependence that is an important problem in the panel data studies. Although no significant relationship found between economic freedom and total factor productivity, cointegration analysis revealed that economic freedom matters for economic growth in OECD countries in the long-run, and estimation results showed that direction of the impact is negative.","rank": 493,"year": 2012,"volume": 12,"issue": 3,"startpage": 1850263,"endpage": 1850263,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ekrem Erdem","Can Tansel Tugcu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "<p>Foreign Body and Caustic Substance Ingestion in Childhood</p>","source": "Open Access Emergency Medicine","issn": "1179-1500","publisher": "Informa UK Limited","doi": "10.2147/oaem.s241190","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/oaem.s241190","fulltext_url": "https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=63356","rank": 494,"year": 2020,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 341,"endpage": 352,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Mustafa Erman Dörterler","Tansel Günendi"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Preliminary investigation to characterize deposits forming during combustion of biogas from anaerobic digesters and landfills","source": "Renewable Energy","issn": "0960-1481","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.renene.2015.02.060","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.02.060","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0960148115001780","rank": 495,"year": 2015,"volume": 80,"issue": 0,"startpage": 674,"endpage": 681,"cites": 19,"ecc": 19,"use": 1,"authors": ["Sharon C.

The goals of this study are twofold. First, we investigate whether the near-elderly who face higher health risks save more. Second, we examine the factors that contribute to health risks that the near-elderly face. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to construct two measures of health risks. Our results do not support the hypothesis that household savings increase with the health risks that they face. Individuals who confront higher health risks in the future are those who are already in fair or poor health status or those who have a health condition such as diabetes or lung disease. Lower earnings and high medical expenditures caused by current poor health status prevent households from accumulating savings for future health adversities.","rank": 516,"year": 2013,"volume": 36,"issue": 2,"startpage": 180,"endpage": 206,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yilmazer","Robert L.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the limited body of empirical evidence available on mobility and informality in the Turkish labor market. Design/methodology/approach: Toward this end, the authors use Turkish income and Living Conditions Survey panel data for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 to compute the Markov transition probabilities of individuals moving across six different labor market states: formal-salaried (FS), informal-salaried, formal self-employed, informal self-employed, unemployed and inactive. In order to examine the nature of mobility patterns in more detail, the authors then estimate six multinomial logit models individually for each transition adopting a number of individual and employment characteristics as explanatory variables. Findings: The authors find evidence that mobility patterns are fairly similar across different time spans, the probability of remaining in initial state is higher than the probability of transition into another state for all the labor market states, except for unemployment, there is only very limited mobility into the FS state. Gender, education and sector of economic activity are observed to display significant effects on mobility patterns. The results reveal several relationships between the covariates and likelihood of variant transitions. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a comprehensive and detailed diagnosis of the Turkish labor market. The market is observed to display a rather static structure throughout the period considered. The results indicate that a well recognition of underlying dynamics may help policy makers to produce various effective tools for addressing informality. Originality/value: First study to analyze labor market mobility across formal/informal sectors using newly available panel data.","rank": 529,"year": 2017,"volume": 44,"issue": 4,"startpage": 617,"endpage": 635,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Elif Öznur Acar"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Development of a decision support system for machining center selection","source": "Expert Systems with Applications","issn": "0957-4174","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2008.02.022","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2008.02.022","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S095741740800105X","rank": 530,"year": 2009,"volume": 36,"issue": 2,"startpage": 3505,"endpage": 3513,"cites": 54,"ecc": 54,"use": 1,"authors": ["Yusuf Tansel İç","Mustafa Yurdakul"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Analyzing Wage Differentials by Fields of Study: Evidence from Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3029785","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3029785","rank": 531,"year": 2017,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Antonio Di Paolo","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Output feedback adaptive stabilization and command following for minimum phase dynamical systems with unmatched uncertainties and disturbances","source": "International Journal of Control","issn": "0020-7179","publisher": "Informa UK Limited","doi": "10.1080/00207179.2012.662721","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207179.2012.662721","fulltext_url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00207179.2012.662721","rank": 532,"year": 2012,"volume": 85,"issue": 6,"startpage": 706,"endpage": 721,"cites": 16,"ecc": 16,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yucelen","Wassim M.

Design/methodology/approach: Companies or governments that make location selection decisions to improve their performance in new investment decisions for different service industries. On the other hand, disasters, especially earthquakes, force the governments to evaluate their existing potentialities and develop action plans to improve their middle and long-term preparations. This paper proposes a VIKOR method-based location selection model for the field hospital to build after a possible earthquake. Also, the authors present a methodology using the VIKOR method that how government agencies take action for the field hospital's location selection process via VIKOR methodology. Findings: The modeling and application results show that the field hospital's location selection decision-making process improves considerably using the VIKOR model. This paper shows that the proposed VIKOR-based model can rank alternatives suitability at various criteria targeting to minimize the possible earthquake's impact and obtains a single overall ranking score to select the best alternative. Research limitations/implications: The study does not consider the uncertain nature of the field hospital selection problem. The application part is restricted to the Ankara case. But the proposed model can easily extend for different locations in the world. Originality/value: This paper presents the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework study of the establishment of field hospitals and demonstrates its importance when criteria diversity is restricted.","rank": 573,"year": 2021,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Inanç Barutcu","Yusuf Tansel Ic"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Effect of Private Tutoring on University Entrance Examination Performance in Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.721925","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.721925","rank": 574,"year": 2005,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Fatma Bircan Bodur"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Robust integrated framework for effective feature selection and sample classification and its application to gene expression data analysis","source": "2012 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/cibcb.2012.6217219","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cibcb.2012.6217219","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/6210991/6217201/06217219.pdf?arnumber=6217219","rank": 575,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Shang Gao","Omar Addam","Ala Qabaja","Abdallah ElSheikh","Omar Zarour","Mohamad Nagi","Flouris Triant","Wadhah Almansoori","Omer Sair Tansel Ozyer","Jia Zeng","Jon Rokne","Reda Alhajja"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Gender Effects of Education on Economic Development in Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2056722","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2056722","rank": 576,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Nil Demet Güngör"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Defining and Measuring Informality in the Turkish Labor Market","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2481566","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2481566","rank": 577,"year": 2014,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Elif Oznur Kan","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Adaptive Loop Transfer Recovery","source": "Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","issn": "0731-5090","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)","doi": "10.2514/1.55835","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/1.55835","fulltext_url": "http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.55835","rank": 578,"year": 2012,"volume": 35,"issue": 3,"startpage": 807,"endpage": 815,"cites": 42,"ecc": 42,"use": 1,"authors": ["Anthony J.

New NTMPs are developed continually and the total number of NTMPs being used in the machining industry is increasing so that ranking and selection of the most proper NTMP requires multi-level and systematic models. [M. Yurdakul and C. Cogun, Development of a multi-attribute selection procedure for non-traditional machining processes, Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. J. Eng. Manuf.217 (2003) 993–1009] developed such an NTMP ranking model. The developed NTMP ranking model in [M. Yurdakul and C. Cogun, Development of a multi-attribute selection procedure for non-traditional machining processes, Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. J. Eng. Manuf.217 (2003) 993–1009] had a two-level structure and used crisp Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) together to rank feasible NTMPs. This study aims to replace crisp (nonfuzzy) versions of the AHP and TOPSIS with the fuzzy ones. Application of the fuzzy NTMP ranking model is illustrated and its results are compared with the ones obtained in [M. Yurdakul and C. Cogun, Development of a multi-attribute selection procedure for non-traditional machining processes, Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. J. Eng. Manuf.217 (2003) 993–1009] to evaluate the significance of the differences in ranking results. The comparisons show that using fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS approaches instead of the crisp ones in the ranking model provided considerable ranking differences. The fuzzy NTMP ranking model is studied furthermore in the paper by updating the NTMP list and fine-tuning fuzzy weights of the pertinent attributes.","rank": 603,"year": 2019,"volume": 18,"issue": 2,"startpage": 167,"endpage": 192,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Mustafa Yurdakul","Yusuf Tansel İç"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Hazard Analysis of Unemployment Duration by Gender in a Developing Country: The Case of Turkey","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1579566","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1579566","rank": 604,"year": 2010,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","H.

The characteristic symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, such as resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability and gait imbalance, are thought to be a result of the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra compacta, resulting in insufficient dopamine integrated signalling on GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Despite tremendous research, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease have remained largely unknown. Although a variety of possible pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including excessive release of oxygen free radicals, impairment of mitochondrial function, loss of trophic support, abnormal kinase activity, disruption of calcium homeostasis, dysfunction of protein degradation and neuroinflammation, the pathogenesis is still largely uncertain, and there is currently no effective cure for Parkinson’s disease. To develop potential therapies for Parkinson’s disease, inflammatory processes, mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, production of reactive aldehydes, excitotoxicity and synucleinopathies are to be targeted. In this respect, vasoactive intestinal peptide has beneficial effects that provide an advantage for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Vasoactive intestinal peptide is a major neuropeptide-neurotransmitter having antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neurotropic, neuromodulator, and anti-apoptotic properties. In addition to its direct neuroprotective actions regulating the activity of astrocytes, microglia and brain mast cells, it also plays important roles for neuronal adaptation, maintenance and survival.","rank": 607,"year": 2019,"volume": 24,"issue": 39,"startpage": 4693,"endpage": 4701,"cites": 11,"ecc": 11,"use": 1,"authors": ["Orhan Tansel Korkmaz","Neşe Tunçel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Effect of conic baffles in the shell and helical tube heat exchangers","source": "Energy & Environment","issn": "0958-305X","publisher": "SAGE Publications","doi": "10.1177/0958305x19846871","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305x19846871","fulltext_url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0958305X19846871","rank": 608,"year": 2019,"volume": 30,"issue": 8,"startpage": 1437,"endpage": 1455,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Koyun","Omar M Jumaah"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Marriage and the Allocation of Assets in Women’s Defined Contribution Plans","source": "Journal of Family and Economic Issues","issn": "1058-0476","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s10834-010-9191-6","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10834-010-9191-6","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10834-010-9191-6.pdf","rank": 609,"year": 2010,"volume": 31,"issue": 2,"startpage": 121,"endpage": 137,"cites": 39,"ecc": 39,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Yilmazer","Angela C.

Consequences of migration both at destinations and origins are considered. According to the robust regressions estimated, the relationship between turnout and education is inverse U-shaped, and between turnout and age (including generational effects), it is U-shaped. Immigration, emigration, large population, a large number of parliament members elected from a constituency, participation by large number of parties, and existence of a dominant party depress the turnout rate. However, at destinations where large numbers of immigrants from different regions are concentrated, the opportunity afforded to them to elect one of their own reduces the adverse impact of immigration significantly and in some cases even turns it to positive. That emigration, and education beyond certain level, have negative effects on turnout, that immigration’s adverse effect is less in areas with high migrant concentrations, and that in Turkey, political participation is highest among the youngest voters are the novel findings of the study. The latter finding may explain why voter turnout declines in Europe and North America but not in Turkey.

Since, employment is a variable which moves together with GDP and it is accepted as one of the preconditions of economic growth; one can simply assume that the anticipated relation between economic freedom and employment is positive, too. This study aims at investigating the preassumed relationship between economic freedom and employment in the Turkic Republics by covering panel data of the period 1998-2010. To this end, economic freedom index of considered countries regressed over employment indicators (i.e. total employment level and labor participation rate) and found positive relationship between economic freedom and employment. A percent increase in the degree of economic freedom raises total emploment level and labor participation rate by 0.23% and 0.15%, respectively. These findings imply that if the governments of considered countries wish higher employment levels, they should give more importance on economic freedom.","rank": 636,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ekrem Erdem","Can Tansel Tuğcu"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "The effects of globalization on higher education and accounting education in turkey","source": "Journal of Higher Education and Science","issn": "2146-5959","publisher": "Zonguldak Karaelmas University","doi": "10.5961/jhes.2019.335","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5961/jhes.2019.335","fulltext_url": "http://higheredu-sci.org/doi.php?doi=10.5961/jhes.2019.335","rank": 637,"year": 2019,"volume": 9,"issue": 2,"startpage": 335,"endpage": 335,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Nida Turegun","Can Tansel Kaya"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "The role of Helicobacter pylori in vitamin‐B 12 deficiency due to metformin use","source": "Helicobacter","issn": "1083-4389","publisher": "Wiley","doi": "10.1111/hel.12718","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hel.12718","fulltext_url": "https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fhel.12718","rank": 638,"year": 2020,"volume": 25,"issue": 5,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Melih Tansel Gökışık","Seyit Uyar"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Modeling the Propagation of Lamb Waves using a Genetic Algorithm and S-transformation","source": "Structural Health Monitoring","issn": "1475-9217","publisher": "SAGE Publications","doi": "10.1177/1475921707072060","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1475921707072060","fulltext_url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1475921707072060","abstract": "Many structural health monitoring (SHM) applications in use monitor the progress of Lamb waves across a test object in order to detect structural problems, such as cracks and material losses.

Two time domain models, time delay–attenuation (DA) and time delay–attenuation–phase (DAP), are utilized to represent the propagation of Lamb waves in a compact and meaningful model. The parameters of the models are estimated by using genetic algorithm (GA) techniques. The results of the study show that the DA and DAP models work effectively on the simulated and experimental data.","rank": 639,"year": 2007,"volume": 6,"issue": 1,"startpage": 25,"endpage": 37,"cites": 12,"ecc": 12,"use": 1,"authors": ["X.

In this work, we show that it is possible to form a rippled surface morphology through a geometrical self-assembly process using a chemical oblique angle etching technique. We observe in our Monte Carlo simulations that obliquely incident reactive species preferentially etch the hills that are exposed to the beam direction due to the shadowing effect. In addition, species with non-unity sticking (etching) coefficients can be re-emitted from the side walls of the hills and etch the valleys, which at the end can lead to the formation of ripples along the direction of the beam. This mechanism is quite different than the previously reported ripple formation during ion-beam bombarded surfaces where the particles have much higher energies, lower incidence angle and ripple formation is mainly due to physical deformation of the surface. We investigate the ripple formation process in our simulated surfaces for a wide range of etching angle and sticking coefficient values.","rank": 641,"year": 2007,"volume": 1059,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Mehmet F.

Given that there are differences in the URs and participation rates of men and women, the authors perform separate analysis for them also. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use co-integration analysis to investigate the existence of a long-run relationship between UR and LFPR in Canada using time series monthly data for the past 40 years. Findings: The finding that there is long-run relationship between UR and LFPR leads the authors to doubt the pertinence of the unemployment invariance hypothesis for Canada. The authors further find evidence for added-worker effect for men and discouraged-worker effect for women in Canada and the authors elaborate on the possible explanations for this seemingly contradictory finding. Practical implications: The lack of support for the unemployment invariance hypotheses implies that changes in the participation rate which may be due to aging population, policies of early retirement or constraints on working time will affect the UR in the long run. Originality/value: This paper investigates the unemployment invariance hypothesis in Canada to come up with policy implications about long-run UR. The authors further elaborate on the possible explanations for the added-worker effect for men and the discouraged-worker effect for women that the authors find in this study.","rank": 672,"year": 2018,"volume": 39,"issue": 7,"startpage": 929,"endpage": 936,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aysit Tansel","Zeynel Abidin Ozdemir"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Brain Drain from Turkey: The Case of Professionals Abroad","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.962373","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.962373","rank": 673,"year": 2007,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Nil Demet Gungor","Aysit Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "On Parametric Medians of Trees","source": "Transportation Science","issn": "0041-1655","publisher": "Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)","doi": "10.1287/trsc.26.2.149","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.26.2.149","fulltext_url": "https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/trsc.26.2.149","rank": 674,"year": 1992,"volume": 26,"issue": 2,"startpage": 149,"endpage": 156,"cites": 7,"ecc": 7,"use": 1,"authors": ["Erhan Erkut","Barbaros C.

This research presents the first extended study of the Aeromonas veronii infection in sea bass on the Turkish coast of the Aegean Sea. An outbreak was observed in three different sea bass farms and diseased fish with clinical symptoms were sampled. Abdominal distention, hemorrhages on the body and anus, enlarged spleen and liver, and hemorrhages in the internal organs were detected from clinical and pathological examinations. Biochemical and molecular identification confirmed the pathogen to be A.veronii.The histopathological observations demonstrated that the pathogen caused bacterial colonies in the fibrous connective tissue, granuloma, and vacuolar degeneration.The primary causes of the disease were proved through an infection experiment. 80% and 90% mortality were calculated in 0.85 x 108 CFU ml-1 and 1.28 x 108 CFU ml-1 experimentally infected groups with clinical and pathological signs of the disease respectively. Recently, the pathological symptoms of the disease had been confused with pasteurellosis infection in cage farms but the presence of A.veronii has been confirmed in the current study. A detailed study is needed to investigate the overall status of the disease in the Aegean Sea in order to design an appropriate preventive strategy.","rank": 687,"year": 2021,"volume": 72,"issue": 3,"startpage": 3051,"endpage": 3051,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["T TANSEL TANRIKUL","E DINÇTÜRK"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Health and Financial Strain: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances","source": "Southern Economic Journal","issn": "0038-4038","publisher": "Wiley","doi": "10.1002/j.2325-8012.2005.tb00681.x","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.2325-8012.2005.tb00681.x","fulltext_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.2325-8012.2005.tb00681.x","rank": 688,"year": 2005,"volume": 71,"issue": 4,"startpage": 873,"endpage": 890,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Angela C.

They are distinct due to the contrast between successive layers with regard to grain size, composition, color, and sedimentary structures, such as graded beds. Typically, the degree of lamination is controlled by the sedimentation rate and flow regime. Herein, we developed a mudstone classification scheme in terms of lamination because lamination-based shale facies are related to differing features in mineral composition, porosity, and Young’s modulus. This study also attempts to verify whether wireline log patterns are relevant to shale lithofacies. The relationship between the porosity and lamination of the Montney Formation can be used to estimate reservoir properties. Our results show that an increased silt lamina in mudstone leads to an increase in the quartz and calcite contents and a decrease in the clay content, which increases the porosity, permeability, and Young’s modulus. However, reservoir quality is not solely dependent on lamination because of the complex interaction between components. The degree of lamination affected the neutron, density, and sonic log responses. Furthermore, the presence of lamination tends to decrease the neutron percentage, with similar trends in density and sonic log box plots in the study area. When the percentage of clay or cement material decreases, the neutron and density log responses diminish. Meanwhile, when the rock texture variation increases with an increase in the degree of lamination, the sonic log response decreases.","rank": 703,"year": 2021,"volume": 2021,"issue": 0,"startpage": 1,"endpage": 14,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Juhwan Woo","Hyun Suk Lee","Carl Ozyer","Chul Woo Rhee"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Does bone impaction technique reduce tunnel enlargement in ACL reconstruction?","source": "International Orthopaedics","issn": "0341-2695","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s00264-007-0496-5","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00264-007-0496-5","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00264-007-0496-5.pdf","rank": 704,"year": 2008,"volume": 33,"issue": 2,"startpage": 407,"endpage": 412,"cites": 20,"ecc": 20,"use": 1,"authors": ["Alper Gokce","Tahsin Beyzadeoglu","Fatih Ozyer","Halil Bekler","Fahri Erdogan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Fiber Ve Metal Destekli Postların Klinik Ve Radyolojik Olarak Değerlendirilmesi: 5 Yıllık Takip","source": "Marmara Dental Journal","issn": "2147-7280","publisher": "Marmara University","doi": "10.12990/erd.2018248788","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.12990/erd.2018248788","rank": 705,"year": 2018,"volume": 2,"issue": 2,"startpage": 40,"endpage": 46,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Erkut Kahramanoglu","Elcin Keskin Ozyer","Coskun Yildiz","Yasemin Kulak Ozkan"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "A framework for 3D interactive applications on the web","source": "SIGGRAPH Asia 2011 Posters on - SA '11","publisher": "ACM Press","doi": "10.1145/2073304.2073369","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2073304.2073369","fulltext_url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2073369&amp;ftid=1060645&amp;dwn=1","rank": 706,"year": 2011,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Halic","Woojin Ahn","Suvranu De"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Mercury contamination in the riparian zones along the East Fork Poplar Creek at Oak Ridge","source": "Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety","issn": "0147-6513","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.10.009","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.10.009","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0147651310002940","rank": 707,"year": 2011,"volume": 74,"issue": 3,"startpage": 467,"endpage": 472,"cites": 8,"ecc": 8,"use": 1,"authors": ["P.

Using Gallup World Poll data on individual opinions and beliefs and migration aspirations, we find that individuals who intend to emigrate to high-income countries exhibit significantly lower levels of religiosity than the rest of the population. They also share more gender-egalitarian views, although this effect holds only among the young (aged 15 to 30), among single women, and in countries with a Sunni minority. For countries most affected by the Arab Spring, the intensity of cultural selection has decreased since 2011. Still, the aggregate effects of cultural selection should not be overestimated. Self-selection along cultural traits has statistically significant but limited effects on the cultural distance between people (i.e., between migrants and natives at destination or between non-migrants in origin and destination countries). Emigration could even reverse the selection effect and lead to cultural convergence if migrants abroad transfer more progressive norms and beliefs to their home country, a mechanism that deserves more attention in future research.","rank": 720,"year": 2019,"volume": 54,"issue": 2,"startpage": 388,"endpage": 422,"cites": 8,"ecc": 8,"use": 1,"authors": ["Frédéric Docquier","Aysit Tansel","Riccardo Turati"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Consensus with reduced communication links via relative neighboring velocity information","source": "2015 American Control Conference (ACC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/acc.2015.7171859","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/acc.2015.7171859","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/7160954/7170700/07171859.pdf?arnumber=7171859","rank": 721,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Gerardo De La Torre","Tansel Yucelen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Development and Validation of an <i>In Vitro</i> Dissolution Method Based on HPLC Analysis for L-Dopa Release From PLGA Nanoparticles","source": "Bezmialem Science","issn": "2148-2373","publisher": "Bezmialem Vakif University","doi": "10.14235/bas.galenos.2020.3860","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.14235/bas.galenos.2020.3860","rank": 722,"year": 2021,"volume": 9,"issue": 1,"startpage": 9,"endpage": 19,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Sema ARISOY","Özgün SAYINER","Tansel ÇOMOĞLU"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Virtual Reality Training Helpful in Motor and Cognition in Corticobasal Syndrome: A Case Report PET Study","source": "Case Reports in Neurology","issn": "1662-680X","publisher": "S.

CBS is poorly responsive to levodopa. Non-pharmacological strategies have been found to be useful as components of a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach for patients with CBS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of virtual reality training in addressing symptoms of CBS. A 64-year-old man was clinically diagnosed as CBS one year after the onset of complaints. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed asymmetrical hypometabolism in the right thalamus and basal ganglia. The patient was evaluated for balance, gait, mobility, and cognition 1 week before, 1 week after, and 1 year after 6 weeks of training, 3 times weekly (18 sessions in total). All clinical outcomes and PET result had improved after the intervention; cognition and balance were maintained after 1 year. Additionally, the asymmetric hypometabolism, which had been detectable on the PET scan, became normal, and a relative improvement was noted in the visual evaluation of cortical involvement. Virtual reality may address different aspects of motor and cognition and possibly brain metabolic changes that can affect the course of the disease in patients with CBS.","rank": 723,"year": 2020,"volume": 12,"issue": 2,"startpage": 238,"endpage": 246,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Farzin Hajebrahimi","Tansel Cakir","Lutfu Hanoglu"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Enhanced Graph Based Genealogical Record Linkage","source": "Advanced Data Mining and Applications","issn": "0302-9743","publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg","doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-73871-8_44","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-73871-8_44","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-73871-8_44","rank": 724,"year": 2007,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 476,"endpage": 487,"cites": 2,"ecc": 2,"use": 1,"authors": ["Cary Sweet","Tansel Özyer","Reda Alhajj"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Integrating multi-objective genetic algorithm based clustering and data partitioning for skyline computation","source": "Applied Intelligence","issn": "0924-669X","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s10489-009-0206-7","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-009-0206-7","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-009-0206-7.pdf","rank": 725,"year": 2009,"volume": 35,"issue": 1,"startpage": 110,"endpage": 122,"cites": 51,"ecc": 51,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Özyer","Ming Zhang","Reda Alhajj"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Command Governor-Based Adaptive Control of an Autonomous Helicopter","source": "AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference","publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi": "10.2514/6.2012-4830","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2012-4830","fulltext_url": "http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2012-4830","rank": 726,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Daniel Magree","Tansel Yucelen","Eric Johnson"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Residual stress modeling of density modulated silicon thin films using finite element analysis","source": "Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films","issn": "0734-2101","publisher": "American Vacuum Society","doi": "10.1116/1.4902953","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1116/1.4902953","fulltext_url": "http://avs.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1116/1.4902953","rank": 727,"year": 2015,"volume": 33,"issue": 2,"startpage": 21503,"endpage": 21503,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["Erman Citirik","Taha Demirkan","Tansel Karabacak"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "On the single-assignment p-hub center problem","source": "European Journal of Operational Research","issn": "0377-2217","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/s0377-2217(99)00274-x","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0377-2217(99)00274-x","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S037722179900274X","rank": 728,"year": 2000,"volume": 125,"issue": 3,"startpage": 648,"endpage": 655,"cites": 95,"ecc": 95,"use": 1,"authors": ["Bahar Y Kara","Barbaros Ç Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Electrical and optical performances with extracted minority carrier lifetimes of InAs/GaSb SL photodetector operating in the mid wavelength infrared range","source": "Superlattices and Microstructures","issn": "0749-6036","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.spmi.2017.08.022","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spmi.2017.08.022","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0749603617317020","rank": 729,"year": 2017,"volume": 111,"issue": 0,"startpage": 1211,"endpage": 1216,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["T.

The aged samples were tested by pin-on-disk-type standard wear equipment. The results showed that casting into different mold materials resulted in different microstructures of A356 alloy. Microstructures of the Al–Si–Mg alloy differ depending on the mold materials. Secondary dendrite arm space (SDAS) decreased proportionally with increasing cooling rate. Based on the cooling rate, hardness values of the alloy also differ. As the cooling rate increased, hardness of the alloy increased. The SDAS increased due to the decreasing cooling rate. In wear tests, increasing weight loss was observed with decreasing cooling rate.","rank": 736,"year": 2017,"volume": 36,"issue": 5,"startpage": 515,"endpage": 521,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Musa Yildirim","Dursun Özyürek","Tansel Tunçay"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "State Emulator-Based Adaptive Architectures for Resilient Networked Multiagent Systems Over Directed and Time-Varying Graphs","source": "Volume 3: Multiagent Network Systems; Natural Gas and Heat Exchangers; Path Planning and Motion Control; Powertrain Systems; Rehab Robotics; Robot Manipulators; Rollover Prevention (AVS); Sensors and Actuators; Time Delay Systems; Tracking Control Systems; Uncertain Systems and Robustness; Unmanned, Ground and Surface Robotics; Vehicle Dynamics Control; Vibration and Control of Smart Structures/Mech Systems; Vibration Issues in Mechanical Systems","publisher": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers","doi": "10.1115/dscc2015-9802","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/dscc2015-9802","fulltext_url": "http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DSCC2015-9802/4445537/v003t37a006-dscc2015-9802.pdf","abstract": "In this paper, we present adaptive architectures for networked multiagent systems operating over directed networks to achieve resilient coordination in the presence of disturbances.

Within this area there are transformations primarily concerned with diffusion and those that have a displacive nature. There has been extensive work focussed upon applying the phase field method to diffusive transformations leaving much desired for models that can incorporate displacive transformations. Using the current model, the formation of martensite, which is formed via a displacive transformation, is simulated. The existence of a transformation matrix in the free energy expression along with cubic symmetry operations enables the reproduction of the 24 grain variants of martensite. Furthermore, upon consideration of the chemical free energy term, the model is able to utilise both the displacive and diffusive aspects of bainite formation, reproducing the autocatalytic nucleation process for multiple sheaves using a single phase field variable. Transformation matrices are available for many steels, one of which is used within the model.","rank": 749,"year": 2014,"volume": 922,"issue": 0,"startpage": 31,"endpage": 36,"cites": 5,"ecc": 5,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel T.

In particular, (i) implies that both active (i.e., subject to observations of a process of interest) and passive (i.e., subject to no observations) nodes can be present in the sensor network. Furthermore, (ii) implies that active nodes can observe different measurements from a process (e.g., a subset of active nodes can observe position measurements and the rest can observe velocity measurements for a target tracking problem). In this paper, we focus on heterogeneous sensor networks, sensor networks with (i) and (ii), and present a new distributed input and state estimation approach. In addition to the presented theoretical contribution including the stability and performance of the proposed estimation approach, an illustrative numerical example is also given to demonstrate its efficacy.","rank": 772,"year": 2017,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Dzung Tran","Tansel Yucelen","Sarangapani Jagannathan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Rethinking the energy-growth nexus: Proposing an index of sustainable economic welfare for Sub-Saharan Africa","source": "Energy Research & Social Science","issn": "2214-6296","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.009","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.009","fulltext_url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214629616300718","rank": 773,"year": 2016,"volume": 17,"issue": 0,"startpage": 147,"endpage": 159,"cites": 36,"ecc": 36,"use": 1,"authors": ["Angeliki N.

The procurement, kitchen and Food&Beverage managers of five international chain hotels particicipated in the in-depth interviews (in total 15 interviews). As a result of the interviews it was determined that the three elements considered in the reduction of waste were ‘expiration date’, ‘packaging’ and ‘wholesale procurement’. There are three main reasons for the food waste generation; large portions, expiration dates and the guests themself. The staudy investigates the most common waste generated in the hotels. The results of the study have shown that geographic location is an important barrier for recycling due to the lack environmentally friendly suppliers and recycling companies in some regions.","rank": 785,"year": 2021,"volume": 12,"issue": 2,"startpage": 382,"endpage": 382,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tercan TANSEL","Gaukhar YESHENKULOVA","Ulbossyn NURMANOVA"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "SPILL PREVENTION PRIORITY ANALYSIS FOR REDUCING ACCIDENTAL RELEASE RISKS DURING PIPELINE TRANSPORT","source": "Journal of Environmental Systems","issn": "0047-2433","publisher": "Portico","doi": "10.2190/81de-f9g6-xv7t-7ptx","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2190/81de-f9g6-xv7t-7ptx","rank": 786,"year": 2001,"volume": 28,"issue": 4,"startpage": 319,"endpage": 335,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["BERRIN TANSEL","MONALI NAKHATE","ORHAN SEVIMOGLU"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Do Emigrants Self-Select Along Cultural Traits?

Söz konusu ilişkinin incelenmesi amacıyla dört farklı kâr yönetimi tahmin modeli kullanılmış ve dört hipotez test edilmiştir. Çalışma kapsamında BIST İmalat Sektöründe faaliyet gösteren firmalara ait 2011 – 2016 yıllarını kapsayan veriler kullanılmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlara göre; yönetim kurulu içindeki bağımsız üye oranının tahakkuk ve gelir manipülasyonu temelli kâr yönetimi uygulamaları ile ilişkili olduğu ve yönetim kurulundaki kadın üye oranının artmasının nakit akışı ve gelir manipülasyonu temelli kâr yönetimi uygulamalarını azalttığı görülmüştür. Yönetim kurulu büyüklüğünün artmasının da nakit akışı ve gelir manipülasyonu temelli kâr yönetimi uygulamalarını azalttığı tespit edilmiştir. Çalışma kapsamında elde edilen bulguların denetim komitesi üye oranının kâr yönetimi uygulamalarını azalttığı hipotezini desteklemediği sonucuna ulaşılmıştır.","rank": 822,"year": 2018,"volume": 5,"issue": 4,"startpage": 119,"endpage": 136,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Hüseyin TEMİZ","Elçin DALKILIÇ","Tansel HACIHASANOĞLU"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "MedCase","source": "Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","publisher": "ACM","doi": "10.1145/2492517.2500331","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2492517.2500331","fulltext_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2492517.2500331","rank": 823,"year": 2013,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Hsien-Tseng Wang","Abdullah Uz Tansel"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Employment and Other Income Sources Among Homeless Youth","source": "The Journal of Primary Prevention","issn": "0278-095X","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s10935-018-0511-1","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10935-018-0511-1","fulltext_url": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10935-018-0511-1.pdf","rank": 824,"year": 2018,"volume": 39,"issue": 3,"startpage": 247,"endpage": 262,"cites": 7,"ecc": 7,"use": 1,"authors": ["Natasha Slesnick","Jing Zhang","Tansel Yilmazer"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Teaching Undergraduate Artificial Intelligence Classes: An Experiment with an Attendance Requirement","source": "Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","issn": "2374-3468","publisher": "Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)","doi": "10.1609/aaai.v34i09.7060","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i09.7060","fulltext_url": "https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7060/6914","abstract": "We report on an experiment that we performed when we taught the undergraduate artificial intelligence class at the University of Southern California. We taught it – under very similar conditions – once with and once without an attendance requirement. The attendance requirement substantially increased the attendance of the students. It did not substantially affect their performance but decreased their course ratings across all categories in the official course evaluation, whose results happened to be biased toward the opinions of the students attending the lectures. For example, the overall rating of the instructor was 0.89 lower (on a 1-5 scale) with the attendance requirement and the overall rating of the class was 0.85 lower. Thus, the attendance requirement, combined with the policy for administering the course evaluation, had a large impact on the course ratings, which is a problem if the course ratings influence decisions on promotions, tenure, and salary increments for the instructors but also demonstrates the potential for the manipulation of course ratings.","rank": 825,"year": 2020,"volume": 34,"issue": 0,"startpage": 13374,"endpage": 13380,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Sven Koenig","Tansel Uras","Liron Cohen"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Left ventricular apical puncture: A procedure surviving well into the new millennium","source": "Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions","issn": "1522-1946","publisher": "Wiley","doi": "10.1002/(sici)1522-726x(200001)49:1<68::aid-ccd15>3.0.co;2-5","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1522-726x(200001)49:1<68::aid-ccd15>3.0.co;2-5","fulltext_url": "https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F(SICI)1522-726X(200001)49:1%3C68::AID-CCD15%3E3.0.CO;2-5","rank": 826,"year": 2000,"volume": 49,"issue": 1,"startpage": 68,"endpage": 73,"cites": 8,"ecc": 8,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Turgut","Michael Deeb","Mauro Moscucci"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Multimodal Interactive Simulations on the Web","source": "OpenGL Insights","publisher": "A K Peters/CRC Press","doi": "10.1201/b12288-50","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/b12288-50","fulltext_url": "http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/b12288-50","rank": 827,"year": 2012,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 605,"endpage": 620,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Tansel Halic","Woojin Ahn","Suvranu De"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Enhanced optical absorption and photoresponse of glancing angle deposited CIGS nanorods","source": "2015 IEEE 42nd Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/pvsc.2015.7356121","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2015.7356121","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/7337615/7355590/07356121.pdf?arnumber=7356121","rank": 828,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Matthew Brozak","Hilal Cansizoglu","Tansel Karabacak"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Muhasebe Meslek Mensupları, Muhasebe Çalışanları ve Meslek Mensubu Adaylarının Hile Tutumları ve Raporlama Eğilimlerinin İncelenmesi: Yozgat Örneği","source": "Erciyes Üniversitesi İktisadi ve İdari Bilimler Fakültesi Dergisi","issn": "1301-3688","publisher": "Erciyes University Journal of Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences","doi": "10.18070/erciyesiibd.399422","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.18070/erciyesiibd.399422","rank": 829,"year": 2018,"volume": 0,"issue": 52,"startpage": 213,"endpage": 240,"cites": 1,"ecc": 1,"use": 1,"authors": ["Hüseyin Temiz","Tansel Hacıhasanoğlu","Nurettin Özdemir"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Do Emigrants Self-Select Along Cultural Traits?: Evidence from the MENA Countries","source": "SSRN Electronic Journal","issn": "1556-5068","publisher": "Elsevier BV","doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3073151","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3073151","rank": 830,"year": 2017,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Frrddric Docquier","Aysit Tansel","Riccardo Turati"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Meslek Etiği Dersinin Öğrencilerin Hile Karşısındaki Tutumları ve Raporlama Eğilimleri Üzerindeki Etkisi","source": "Cankiri Karatekin Universitesi Iktisadi ve Idari Bilimler Fakultesi Dergisi","issn": "1308-5549","publisher": "Cankiri Karatekin Universitesi Iktisadi ve Idari Bilimler Fakultesi Dergisi","doi": "10.18074/ckuiibfd.406439","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.18074/ckuiibfd.406439","rank": 831,"year": 2018,"volume": 8,"issue": 2,"startpage": 137,"endpage": 155,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Hüseyin Temiz","Tansel Hacıhasanoğlu","Nurettin Özdemir"]},{"type": "book-chapter","title": "Frequent Itemset Mining and Association Rules","source": "Encyclopedia of Knowledge Management","publisher": "IGI Global","doi": "10.4018/978-1-59140-573-3.ch026","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59140-573-3.ch026","fulltext_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=16951","abstract": "With the advent of mass storage devices, databases have become larger and larger.

Specifically, we analyze stability and boundedness of the overall closed-loop dynamical system, characterize the effect of user-defined thresholds and adaptive controller design parameters to the system performance, and discuss conditions to make the resulting command following performance error sufficiently small.

Specifically, we utilize tools and methods from event-triggering control theory to schedule data exchange dependent upon errors exceeding user-defined thresholds and show the boundedness of the overall closed-loop system using Lyapunov stability. An illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed adaptive control approach.","rank": 909,"year": 2015,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ali Albattat","Benjamin C.

Microsoft Excel is used as a DSS development platform. The DSS application requires the quality characteristics and the level of parameters affecting the problem. The proposed system considers three multi-criteria decision-making methods: TOPSIS, VIKOR and GRA. These methods are integrated into the Taguchi method to convert the multi-response optimization problem to a single-response problem. The DSS suggests proper Taguchi experimental designs and provides the decision maker with an opportunity to use different metrics and to validate the experimental results. Several issues and an application are provided for illustrative purposes. The proposed DSS is tested on a case study (the performance of the mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation solver) and the results highlight that the system is capable of offering satisfactory outcomes. Using such a quick and flexible DSS might help to reduce the daily workload of the decision makers. The different metrics used for the response variables which results with the different parameter combination. Using the optimal parameter combination of TOPSIS (come to the fore in case MinBest metric used), the MIP formulation solver gives the best integer objective function value of 609 and a GAP value of 1.93%, both of which are less than the values obtained using the other methods. Using the optimal parameter combination of GRA (come to the fore in case OptBest metric used), the MIP formulation gives a best integer objective function value of 632 and a GAP value of 6.52%, both of which are less than the values obtained by using the other methods.","rank": 910,"year": 2019,"volume": 18,"issue": 5,"startpage": 1501,"endpage": 1531,"cites": 4,"ecc": 4,"use": 1,"authors": ["Bariş Keçeci","Yusuf Tansel Iç","Ergün Eraslan"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Use of ENDOLOOP® and Endoclips for Closure of Gastrocutaneous Fistula","source": "American Journal of Gastroenterology","issn": "0002-9270","publisher": "Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","doi": "10.14309/00000434-201510001-01612","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.14309/00000434-201510001-01612","fulltext_url": "http://journals.lww.com/ajg/Fulltext/2015/10001/.01612.aspx","rank": 911,"year": 2015,"volume": 110,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Aylin Tansel","Kalpesh Patel","Milena Gould Suarez"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Development of a hybrid financial performance measurement model using AHP and DOE methods for Turkish commercial banks","source": "Soft Computing","issn": "1432-7643","publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC","doi": "10.1007/s00500-021-06589-1","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06589-1","fulltext_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00500-021-06589-1.pdf","rank": 912,"year": 2021,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Yusuf Tansel İç","Mustafa Yurdakul","Esra Pehlivan"]},{"type": "proceedings-article","title": "Adaptive SDRE-Based Nonlinear Sensorless Speed Control for PMSM Drives","source": "2007 39th North American Power Symposium","publisher": "IEEE","doi": "10.1109/naps.2007.4402359","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/naps.2007.4402359","fulltext_url": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/4402275/4402276/04402359.pdf?arnumber=4402359","rank": 913,"year": 2007,"volume": 0,"issue": 0,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 3,"ecc": 3,"use": 1,"authors": ["Peda V.

Genetic variability and character association are prime importance and provide essential contribution for successful breeding programme. In the present research genetic variability, heritability, phenotypic and genotypic correlations of several agronomic characters were studied in fifty-four swiss chard accessions and cultivars. Analysis of variance observed highly significant variations among accessions, and phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was higher magnitude of genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) for all agronomic characters. The lamina length, lamina width, petiole thickness, petiole width, lightness, chroma and leaf dry matter observed high magnitude broad sense heritable characters accompanied with high genetic advance.

The lagoon is in the process of being reconfigured. The simulations are performed using a draft configuration. The effect of winds and the number of particles on the e-folding time is simulated. Results show that the lagoon is strongly dominated by winds with a correlation coefficient of 0.897 between the wind and residual current magnitudes. The lagoon e-folds in 9.1 days under realistic winds and in 14.3 days when there is no wind with confidence levels of 5%. The Lagrangian study uses six simulations with particle numbers ranging between 65073 and 2730486. A methodology based on confidence levels is proposed. It is observed that approximately 784 000 particles are necessary to obtain 5% level of confidence. With a problematic history and new planning options, the lagoon has a potential to be used as an example setting, all-field study ground for anthropogenically engineered coastal ecosystems.","rank": 969,"year": 2021,"volume": 29,"issue": 3,"startpage": 251,"endpage": 262,"cites": 0,"ecc": 0,"use": 1,"authors": ["Banu Tansel Büyükçelebi","Hasan Karabay","Ata Bilgili"]},{"type": "journal-article","title": "Mitigating the Effects of Sensor Uncertainties in Networked Multi-Agent Systems","source": "Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control","issn": "0022-0434","publisher": "ASME International","doi": "10.1115/1.4035092","article_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4035092","fulltext_url": "http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4035092/6123407/ds_139_04_041003.pdf","abstract": "Networked multi-agent systems consist of interacting agents that locally exchange information, energy, or matter. Since these systems do not in general have a centralized architecture to monitor the activity of each agent, resilient distributed control system design for networked multi-agent systems is essential in providing high system performance, reliability, and operation in the presence of system uncertainties. An important class of such system uncertainties that can significantly deteriorate the achievable closed-loop system performance is sensor uncertainties, which can arise due to low sensor quality, sensor failure, sensor bias, or detrimental environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel distributed adaptive control architecture for networked multi-agent systems with undirected communication graph topologies to mitigate the effect of sensor uncertainties. Specifically, we consider agents having identical high-order, linear dynamics with agent interactions corrupted by unknown exogenous disturbances. We show that the proposed adaptive control architecture guarantees asymptotic stability of the closed-loop dynamical system when the exogenous disturbances are time-invariant and uniform ultimate boundedness when the exogenous disturbances are time-varying. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control architecture.","rank": 970,"year": 2017,"volume": 139,"issue": 4,"startpage": 0,"endpage": 0,"cites": 18,"ecc": 18,"use": 1,"authors": ["Ehsan Arabi","Tansel Yucelen","Wassim M.

The imprints of these events in the Upper Cretaceous–Lower Eocene sedimentary record of western Anatolia are studied in thirty-eight well-described stratigraphic sections. During the Late Cretaceous period, western Turkey consisted of two continents, the Pontides in the north and the Anatolide-Taurides in the south. These continental masses were separated by the İzmir-Ankara Neo-Tethyan ocean. During the convergence the Pontides formed the upper plate, the Anatolide-Taurides the lower plate. The arc magmatism in the Pontides along the Black Sea coast is biostratigraphically tightly constrained in time between the late Turonian and latest Campanian. Ophiolite obduction over the passive margin of the Anatolide-Tauride Block started in the Santonian soon after the inception of subduction in the Turonian. As a result, large areas of the Anatolide-Tauride Block subsided and became a region of pelagic carbonate sedimentation during the Campanian. The leading margin of the Anatolide-Tauride Block was buried deeply and was deformed and metamorphosed to blueschist facies during Campanian times. The Campanian arc volcanic rocks in the Pontides are conformably overlain by shaley limestone of Maastrichtian–Palaeocene age. However, Maastrichtian sedimentary sequences north of the Tethyan suture are of fore-arc type suggesting that although arc magmatism ceased by the end of the Campanian age, continent–continent collision was delayed until Palaeocene time, when there was a change from marine to continental sedimentation in the fore-arc basins. The interval between the end of the arc magmatism and continent–continent collision may have been related to a northward jump of the subduction zone at the end of Campanian time, or to continued obduction during the Maastrichtian.","rank": 998,"year": 2001,"volume": 138,"issue": 2,"startpage": 117,"endpage": 142,"cites": 186,"ecc": 186,"use": 1,"authors": ["ARAL I.
